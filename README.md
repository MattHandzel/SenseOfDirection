# SenseOfDirection

Hello! This project is going to be another hapic device, based on the North Paw device here (https://sensebridge.net/projects/northpaw/).

Basically it is an anklet (bracelet that goes on your ankle) where X amount of motors (I am planning on starting with 4) sort of act like a compass. The motor that is in the direction closest to north will buzz to let you know what direction north is in.

The goal with this project is that eventually, the brain will learn how to interpret that constant signal of where north is and incorporate it into my conscious experience of reality, allowing me to have better sense of direction and what-not (it probably sounds very woo-woo).
